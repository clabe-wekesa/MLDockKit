***Lipinsky descriptors***<a name='Lipinsky descriptors'><a/>
Lipinski descriptors are a set of molecular properties used to assess the drug-likeness or pharmacokinetic profile of a chemical compound

***pIC50***<a name='pIC50'><a/>
pIC50 (negative logarithm of the half-maximal inhibitory concentration) is a measure used in pharmacology to represent the potency of a substance in inhibiting a biological target, typically in drug development.
***Molecular docking***<a name='molecular docking'><a/>
Molecular docking is a computational technique used in drug discovery and molecular biology to predict how two molecules, typically a protein and a small molecule ligand, interact with each other and how they bind together, often to evaluate potential drug-receptor interactions.
***Docking vizualization***<a name='docking vizualization'><a/>
Docking visualization refers to the process of visually representing the results of molecular docking simulations. It involves creating graphical representations of how molecules (e.g., ligands and proteins) interact and bind together. These visualizations can help researchers understand and analyze the binding modes, interactions, and potential drug-receptor complexes predicted by docking algorithms, aiding in drug discovery and structural biology studies.
